# CS350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project involved developing a smart thermostat using the TI CC3220 microcontroller, which reads room temperature, controls a heater using an LED indicator, adjusts the temperature set-point using buttons, and simulates data transmission to a server over UART. The problem it solved was creating a prototype that integrates multiple peripherals for IoT applications.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I successfully integrated multiple peripherals (I2C, GPIO, UART) and implemented a task scheduler to handle timing and interactions efficiently. The code was tested thoroughly to ensure reliability.

3. Where could you improve?
Improvement could be made in optimizing the code for better performance and possibly reducing memory usage. 

4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I added the TI Code Composer Studio IDE, TI Resource Explorer, technical documentation for the CC3220, and online forums for support with this particular microcontroller.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Skills in handling microcontroller peripherals, writing interrupt service routines, implementing task scheduling, and using the UART for communication will be valuable for future embedded systems projects.

6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used clear and consistent coding practices, meaningful variable names, and detailed comments to explain the code. Modular functions were implemented to make the code adaptable to changes in hardware or functionality.
